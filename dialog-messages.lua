welcome to the first 
episode of 
"retro gamesmiths". let's
hammer something. 

i have an idea for a game.
i have already prepared
graphics - an anvil and 3
frames of player's
animation.

great! let's have a look...

wow, it's me. i'm
flattened... let's display
the first frame of the
animation.

game's resolution is
128x128. anvil's sprite is
8x8, player 16x16.

that's great.

yeah... maybe let's change
the color of the
background.
